## Audio Visualizer

Produces an in-browser visualization of an audio file using frequency data and
the File, Canvas, and Web Audio APIs.

Users can upload their own audio file to play or use a demo song.

The current deployed version can be found at [audio-visualizer-app.netlify.com](https://audio-visualizer-app.netlify.com).

You can upload your own audio file if you'd like. Or you can hit the
button at the bottom of the page to start the demo song.

Past versions at stages of development are saved in separate branches. Each branch
is also deployed and can be found by prepending the branch name and two hyphens ("--")
to the main deployment URL above.

For example, the branch `file-upload-and-demo` (the first completed implementation) can be found at [file-upload-and-demo--audio-visualizer-app.netlify.com](https://file-upload-and-demo--audio-visualizer-app.netlify.com).
